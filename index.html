    <section class="main-content">
      <p>Membership in the Lutheran church has decreased in recent decades. In 2010 over 80.000 members resigned from church. 20.000 of them right after TV2 broadcasted Homoilta (Gay night) talk show, where conservative comments by e.g. Päivi Räsänen, the chairperson of the Christian Democrats, upset many. </p>

<p>In this study we will look into if and how the Lutheran Church position on e.g. equal marriage law and asylum seekers have influenced on the numbers of people resigned / joined the church; if there is a correlation between public discussion/changes in legislation and number of resigned/joined members of the church. </p>
